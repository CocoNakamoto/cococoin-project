What is Cococoin?
----------------

Cococoin is an experimental digital meme currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Cococoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Cococoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Cococoin Core software, see the release tab.
